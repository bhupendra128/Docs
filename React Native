Trouble Installing?

updated 4-27-2020

If you run into issues when installing the Expo Cli in the upcoming video lecture App Setup, there are a few things you can try.
Windows

1. Try using a different terminal. There are few choices, CMD prompt, PowerShell, GitBash and CMDer.

2. Make sure you have installed Git as one of Expo's dependencies will need it:

3. Make sure that your project files are on the C drive rather than on some external or remote drive. This may be causing permissions errors or inconsistencies with the install.

If the installation seemed like it worked but you are getting errors starting expo, delete your package-lock.json file, node_modules directory and run npm cache clean -f. Then run a new npm install as a regular user. Finally, run an npm start again to install the Expo Cli tools.
macOS

1. Make sure your project is not on the Desktop as the file watchers will have some permissions issues with this location.

If you run into an endless loop:

You may have run into a loop where the terminal prompt keeps asking you to install the global cli tools. If this is the case, you'll need to install the tools manually.

npm install expo-cli --global

If this command fails due to permissions errors, please refer to the npm docs on avoiding the use of sudo:

    On the command line, in your home directory, create a directory for global installations:

         mkdir ~/.npm-global

    Configure npm to use the new directory path:

         npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'

    In your preferred text editor, open or create a ~/.profile file and add this line:

         export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH

    On the command line, update your system variables:

         source ~/.profile

    To test your new configuration, install a package globally without using sudo:

        npm install expo-cli --global

Then attempt to run an npm start again - you should not get prompted to install the tools this time and the Metro Bundler should start up.

IMPORTANT - If you are using macOS Catalina, it is highly likely that your default shell is now zsh. If so, you will need to instead create a ~/.zprofile instead of a ~/.profile when following these instructions:
